#### Gaussian Elimination Program

##### Usage
Change the values of the matrix found in `main.c`. Ensure that there 
5 rows and 10 columns in the matrix. Compile and run main.

##### File Structure
This is my first C project and is purely for educational purposes. As such, 
there were many mistakes and changes along the way. The code from those changes
can be found in the `legacy` folder.

The dependencies of `main.c` are all found in the `src` folder which is subdivided into
`matrix_elements` and `structs`. 

Contained in `matrix_elements` are the custom data types Matrix, Row and Tuple, and in 
`structs` you will find all the object-like structures which organise my elementary row
operation, printing, converting and other functions. I havent been able to go without
objects just yet.

##### Tools Used
- Visual Studio Code + extensions (Code Runner, C/C++)
- Stack Overflow (for all my beginner C questions)
